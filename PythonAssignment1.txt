## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans.Python is an interpreted language. This means that every time a program is run, its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code
Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans.The type-checking is done during the execution of the program.
Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans. Pros:
	It's Simple.
	It's Free.
	It's Easy to Use.
	It's Highly Compatible.
	It is Object-Oriented.
	It has Lots of Libraries.
    Cons:
	Poor Memory Efficiency
	Slow Speed.
	Weak in Mobile Computing
	Runtime Errors
Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans. artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans.variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object.A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it
Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans.Using the input() function, we take input from a user, and using the print() function, we display output on the screen.
Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans.the input() function by default returns the value as string data type
Q8. What is type casting?
Ans.The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting in python.
Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans.No, input() function takes only one Argument.
Q10. What are keywords?
Ans.Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes
Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans.No, we can not use the keywords of Python as a variable name. Keywords are reserved words of Python, which has unique functionality.
Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans.Indentation in Python refers to the (spaces and tabs) that are used at the beginning of a statement. The statements with the same indentation belong to the same group called a suite.
Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans.using Print() function.
Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans.operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed.
Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans. we can perform division in two ways. The first one is Float Division("/") and the second is Integer Division("//") or Floor Division
Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans.n=iNeuron
    for i in range(1,5):
	print(n,end='')
Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans. n=input()
     if(n%2==0):
	print("Even")
     else:
	print("odd")
Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans.returning either True or False
Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```
Ans. True,True,False,True.
Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans.The statement can be a single line or a block of code. #If the condition is true, the statement will be executed
Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans.if… elif…else are conditional statements that provide you with the decision making that is required when you want to execute code based on a particular condition.
Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans.age=int(input())
    if(age>=18):
	print("I can vote")
    else:
	print("I can't vote")
Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans.
sum1=0
for i in numbers:
	if(i%2==0):
	  sum1=sum1+i
print(sum1)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans.l=list(int,input().split(" "))
	print(max(l))
Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
for i in numbers:
	if(i%5==0):
		if(i>150):
			continue
		if(i>500):
		 break
